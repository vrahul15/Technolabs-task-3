# Form a Story

This project is a creative web application that collects user input through a form and generates a personalized story based on the classic "The Tortoise and the Hare" fable.

## Features

- **Modern, Responsive Design:** Built with HTML5 and CSS3, featuring a vibrant animated gradient background and mobile-friendly layout.
- **Interactive Form:** Users fill in animals, adjectives, verbs, numbers, and more to customize the story.
- **Live Story Generation:** Submitted data is parsed and displayed in a fun, dynamic story on a separate page.
- **Motivational Message:** Users can add their own meaningful message as the moral of the story.
- **Reusable:** Easily create new stories by returning to the form.

## How It Works

1. **Fill the Form:** Enter your choices for animals, adjectives, verbs, etc.
2. **Submit:** The form sends your data to `story.html` using a GET request.
3. **Read Your Story:** The story page (`story.html`) uses JavaScript to read your input and display a custom story.
